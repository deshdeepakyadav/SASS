Before you start using Sass you will need to install Ruby. 
The fastest way to get Ruby on your Windows computer is to use Ruby Installer. It's a single-click installer that will get everything set up for you super fast.
The installer will also install a Ruby command line powershell application that will let you use the Ruby libraries.

Installation of Ruby:
----------------------
Step(1):Open the link https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ and download the setup.exe as per your system requirement
Step(2): Next, run the setup to install the Ruby on the System
Step(3): Next, add Ruby bin folder to your PATH User Variable and System Variable to work with gem command. you can also set this varaible at time of installation.
If not set at time of installation then follow the below steps:
Path User Variable:
--Right Click on My Computer.
--Select Properties.
--Next, select Advanced tab and click on Environment Variables. 
--Under Environment Variables window, double click on the PATH.
--You will get an Edit User Variable box. Add ruby bin folder path in the Variable value field as C:\Ruby\bin. If path is already set for other files then put semicolon after that and add the Ruby folder path. 
System Variable:
--Click on New Button.
--Next, New System Variable block gets displayed.
--Enter RubyOpt in the Variable name field and rubygems in the Variable value field. After writing the Variable name and value, click on OK button.
Step(4): Open command prompt in your system and enter the following line.
if SASS is not sucessfull and getting error related to TCP/IP then set proxy with following command and after that repeat step:4
SET HTTP_PROXY=http://%USER%:%PASSWORD%@%SERVER%:%PORT%
set http_proxy=http://one.proxy.att.com:8080

Double-check. You should now have Sass installed, but it never hurts to double-check. In your terminal application you can type:
sass -v

Starting your first app with SASS:
------------------------------------
For creating your first app with SASS, you need to follow with below steps:
Step1:Create a project folder under root directory of your local server.
Step2:Create a Html page,css and sass-css folder inside project folder.
Step3:Create a .scss extention file in your sass-css folder : This folder will keep your all .scss file.
	  css : folder will be used for actual css code as output
Step4: Add css file in your html page as normal way like other css files are included.
	   The name of css file will bed used as output of SASS file.
Step5: For running your sass file use following command, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your web site .
[c:\project_folder> sass sass-css/input.scss css/output.css  ] where input.scss is your sass file and  output.css is your normal css file

For dynamic edit we can set watch on folder/file 
[c:\project_folder> sass --watch sass-css/input.scss:css/output.css  ] as file
[c:\project_folder> sass --watch sass-css:css  ] as folder
